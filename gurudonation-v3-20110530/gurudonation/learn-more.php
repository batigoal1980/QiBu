					<h1>What you need to know about CrowdFunding</h1>
					<p>All of us need some help to collect money.</p> 
					<p>Sometimes you just have no idea how to solve things, it doesn't matter if they are important or not. With this CrowdFunding you should be able to collect the money you need, just asking help <strong>to Internet World</strong>. 
                                        
					<h2>Donation CrowdFunding</h2>
					<p>First thing you have to do is open a <a href="new.php" title="Start your CrowdFunding! It's free!">new CrowdFunding</a> that is the space where you will be able to manage the money collection. You just have to decide and set how much money you need to raise (target amount, e.g. $500), by when (e.g. in 30 days), and why (e.g. "Kevin's Birthday"). </p>

					<p>When a CrowdFunding page is published, you will be able to see infos about it how much money you are collecting.</p>
					<h2>The Givers</h2>
					<p>Anyone can contribute to give you money and reach your target. You can share your CrowdFunding with friends and other people, they will visit your page and can easy give you an offer.  </p>
					<p>While you are collecting money, your CrowdFunding will show the raised sum and the remaining time to receive money.</p>
					<p>Once the CrowdFunding is ended, you cannot collect more money. The page remains online, but the Send Money 
button is disabled. For this reason, people should send money as soon as possible, respecting the timeline.</p>

					<p>You can monitor the progress of your CrowdFundings and <strong>watch your earnings from <a href="myCrowdFundings.php" target="_blank" title="Go to My CrowdFundings">My CrowdFundings page</a></strong>.</p>
					<h2>Money Transactions</h2>
					<p>People can send money through <a href="http://www.paypal.com/" target="_blank" title="Go to PayPal site">PayPal</a>, which allows secure payments and money transfers to be made through the Internet. For this reason, to receive money you should have a Paypal account. A Giver instead deosn't need to have Paypal to give money: he just needs a credit card or other valid type of PayPal payment.</p>
					<p>Every time there is a new money donation, it is sent directly to the CrowdFunding's Creator. GuruDonation.com just make things simpler, that means there is no fee for you. </p>
					<p><strong>Every contribution is a CrowdFunding</strong>, and usually there is no return for the contributor. Of course, the Poster can decide to give 
contributors a benefit or reward (in this case it would be stated on the CrowdFunding Page). Remember, Posters are wholly responsible for their promises, and GuruDonation.com 
has no control if they keep their word or not. <strong>Send money only to Posters you know or you trust</strong>. </p>
					<p>At anytime, you can contact the creator of the CrowdFunding by clicking the <em>Send a Message</em> button on the CrowdFunding Page.</p>
